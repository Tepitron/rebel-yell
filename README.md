Floating Away

This game is about a child escaping to an imaginary world to escape 
from the real world. Arguing parents can be heard in the background.
The child focuses on blowing bubbles in the imagined world. As time progresses,
blowing bubbles becomes harder. It's more of an art experience than a game. 
Don't expect to win it.
